# my-cpama-solutions
My solutions to the exercises and the projects in [K. N. King's "C Programming: A Modern Approach", second edition.](http://knking.com/books/c2/)

## Information

All exercise and project solutions in this repo have been developed during my freshman year of college. With that in mind, if there are some code parts that seem unusual to you, you are most probably right. I'd be really happy if you could reach me and explain the issue so that I could fix it. 

The other chapters' solutions are stored locally on my computer. I'll be sharing them as I organize and divide them into files.
